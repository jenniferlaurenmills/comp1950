                <h2>web space</h2>

                <p>Each student will get personal webspace.  This may be different than in the past, as this space is exclusively yours, with your own username and password.</p>

                <p>This is also not a continuation of your COMP1850 site (if you had one).  This site is primarily for you to house your exercises, assignments, group work and more.  Make it a site that is usable and functional.</p>

                <h3>TheNet Setup</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your account name has already been created: first initial + last name. Example, John Smith would be jsmith</li>
                    <li>Passwords were randomized at account creation, so you will have to create yours</li>
                    <li>
                    Be prepared to enter your password when you come to the front
					<li>Your URL will be: <strong>http://students.thenet.ca/{accountname}</strong></li>

                <h2>FTP into your Account</h2>

                <p>You can use any FTP program you are comfortable with. There is most likely one installed in the labs (it changes from term to term) but you can download and install any one you want.</p>

                <p><a href="https://filezilla-project.org">Filezilla</a> is a great FTP client that works on Mac/PC/Linux if you are looking for one to install on your laptop or at home</p>
                <p>If you aren't knowledgeable with any FTP programs yet, just let me know!</p>

                <p>Here is the relevant information you will need to know:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Host / IP / URL: <strong>thenet.ca</strong></li>
                    <li>Username (It's important that you have the accountname <strong>and</strong> the domain for your Username to work): <strong>{accountname}@thenet.ca</strong></li>
                    <li>Password: <strong>{the password you entered}</strong></li>
                </ul>
